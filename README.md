Exploring the world of Deep Learning with interesting projects


### Details

More details and explanation of each concept as well as breaking down and understanding the code are available in the following [blog](http://datasciencediscovery.com/analytics_street/Deep-Learning.html).

## Projects:

[Image Classification - Invasive Species](http://datasciencediscovery.com/coders_corner/Deep-Learning-image-classification.html): Invasive species can have damaging effects on the environment, the economy, and even human health. Use DL to classify species. This was coded sometime back and utilizes the library Fastai version 0.7, however recently there have been some updates in the library and new releases in pytorch as well. The current code will no longer work with Fastai v1, while I work towards revising the code and making it compatible there is still some important concepts that can be learned from this code.
